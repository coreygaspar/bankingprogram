The Airgead Banking Program is a tool used to calculate investment growth over a set number of years, both with and without monthly deposits. The purpose of this program is to show the user the importance of compound interest and monthly contributions. Most people, especially younger people, don't understand the concept of compound interest and struggle to understand the importance of saving money over time. This program gives people a visualization on how important it is to save money.
