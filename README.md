# Airgead Banking Program

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
---
The Airgead Banking Program is a tool used to calculate investment growth over a set number of years, both with and without monthly deposits. The purpose of this program is to show the user the importance of compound interest and monthly contributions. Most people, especially younger people, don't understand the concept of compound interest and struggle to understand the importance of saving money over time. This program gives people a visualization on how important it is to save money.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think that I did particularly well with the calculations. I implemented compound interest formulas and used monthly compound interest, which produces a more accurate calculation of total savings. I also think I did particularly well with the output formatting. I ran into a few issues with the calculations being off due to formatting but I was able to fix them. For example, my calculations had too many zeros at the end at one point so I had to make sure it was rounded off to two decimal places.

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

For starters, I should have created a limit for interest rate. I should have set a limit for the interest rate to be no greater than 100% but it can exceed that. I could even make that number even smaller if I was trying to be realistic. My code also allows users to enter high deposit values, which could cause some overflow issues.
